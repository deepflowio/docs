# Functionality

Using Prometheus Remote Write, you can export the metrics generated by DeepFlow to external platforms. This allows you to continue leveraging the Prometheus ecosystem, such as viewing metrics and configuring alerts through Prometheus.

# Metrics Overview

Within DeepFlow, metrics can be categorized into two types:

- Application Performance Metrics: [Refer to details](../../../features/universal-map/application-metrics/)
  - Corresponds to `flow_metrics.application*` table data in ClickHouse
- Network Performance Metrics: [Refer to details](../../../features/universal-map/network-metrics/)
  - Corresponds to `flow_metrics.network*` table data in ClickHouse

# Prometheus Remote Write

For the protocol format, refer to Prometheus's pb file definition: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/prompb/remote.proto

# DeepFlow Server Configuration Guide

Add the following configuration under the Server settings to enable metric export:

```yaml
ingester:
  exporters:
    - protocol: prometheus
      enabled: true
      endpoints: [http://127.0.0.1:9091/receive, http://1.1.1.1:9091/receive]
      data-sources:
        - flow_metrics.application_map.1s
      # - flow_metrics.application_map.1m
      # - flow_metrics.application.1s
      # - flow_metrics.application.1m
      # - flow_metrics.network_map.1s
      # - flow_metrics.network_map.1m
      # - flow_metrics.network.1s
      # - flow_metrics.network.1m
      queue-count: 4
      queue-size: 100000
      batch-size: 1024
      flush-timeout: 10
      tag-filters:
      export-fields:
        - $tag
        - $metrics
      extra-headers:
        key1: value1
        key2: value2
      export-empty-tag: false
      export-empty-metrics_disabled: false
      enum-translate-to-name-disabled: false
      universal-tag-translate-to-name-disabled: false
```

# Detailed Parameter Description

| Field         | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| protocol      | strings | Yes      | Fixed value `prometheus`                                                                                    |
| data-sources  | strings | Yes      | Values from `flow_metrics.*` data, `flow_log.*` data is not supported                                       |
| endpoints     | strings | Yes      | Remote receiving address, remote write receiving address, randomly selects one that can send successfully   |
| batch-size    | int     | No       | Batch size, sends in batches when this value is reached. Default: 1024                                      |
| extra-headers | map     | No       | Header fields for remote HTTP requests, for example, if authentication is required, you can add tokens here |
| export-fields | strings | Yes      | Currently does not support `$k8s.label`, recommended configuration: [$tag, $metrics]                        |

[Refer to detailed configuration](./exporter-config/)

# Quick Practice Demo

- Set up a RemoteWrite receiving end, refer to this [demo](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/main/documentation/examples/remote_storage/example_write_adapter) from Prometheus

- Add configuration

```yaml
exporters:
  - protocol: prometheus
    data-sources:
      - flow_metrics.application_map.1s
    endpoints: [http://localhost:1234/receive]
    export-fields:
      - $tag
      - $metrics
```

- Restart DeepFlow Server, after a short wait, you can see the output results at the RemoteWrite receiving end as shown in the figure
