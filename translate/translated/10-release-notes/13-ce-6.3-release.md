# v6.3.9 [2023/09/14]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics
  - Support for parsing FastCGI protocol
  - (Partial) support for parsing MongoDB protocol (thanks to `mickeyzzc`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3618), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/3899))
- AutoTracing: Support for calling APM's Trace API to supplement tracing data
- Profiling: Support for eBPF collection of On-CPU Profile data for compiled (Golang/Rust, etc.) and interpreted (Java, etc.) languages (thanks to `@ic0xgkk`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/2494))
- Agent:
  - Support for running in Sidecar mode within business Pods
  - Support for deployment as a BlueKing Plugin

# v6.3.8 [2023/09/07]

## New Features

N/A

## Optimizations

- Server: Refactored Exporter Interface to facilitate adding more Exporter capabilities (thanks to `@jiekun`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3926), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/3932))

# v6.3.7 [2023/08/31]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics: Support for collecting statement-id of MySQL calls to associate COM_STMT_EXECUTE with COM_STMT_QUERY, thereby tracing SQL statements (thanks to `@wuzongling`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3590))
- Agent: Support for synchronizing IP addresses on loopback interfaces (usually VIP)

## Optimizations

- AutoMetrics: Added endpoint field in the application aggregation metrics table
- Profiling:
  - Optimized the merging logic of Function Stack in flame graphs
  - Compressed storage of Function Stack in ClickHouse
- Agent: Removed the requirement for HostNetwork in K8s Agent
- CLI: Released deepflow-ctl for MacOS (thanks to `@zjj1002`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3710))

# v6.3.6 [2023/08/24]

## New Features

- AutoTracing
  - Support for tracing calls before and after managed ALB/SLB services
  - Added allow_multiple_trace_ids_in_tracing_result configuration item to allow multiple TraceIDs in tracing results
- OpenTelemetry Integration: DeepFlow Server supports running without ClickHouse (Export l7_flow_log to otel-collector)

## Optimizations

- Prometheus: Optimized storage performance of RemoteWrite, and query performance of RemoteRead and PromQL
- Agent: Support for configuring CPU affinity and priority

# v6.3.5 [2023/08/10]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics: Recognize RST disconnections in SLB health checks as normal behavior
- SQL: Added count operator to metrics to calculate the number of rows of raw data
- Prometheus Integration: PromQL supports topk and bottomk functions

## Optimizations

- Wasm Demo
  - Parse error codes in HTTP Payload and reassign response_code and response_exception
  - Parse Protobuf messages in Payload
- Agent
  - Added flow log ignore statistics position (l4_log_ignore_tap_sides) and call log ignore statistics position (l7_log_ignore_tap_sides) to reduce the amount of collected data
  - Support for environments where the number of matching results for network interfaces (tap_interface_regex) exceeds 255

# v6.3.4 [2023/07/27]

## New Features

- AutoTagging: Added capability to automatically associate K8s containers through PID, solving the issue of container resource information tagging for HostNetwork Pods in eBPF data
- Prometheus Integration: Support for obtaining HTTP Headers in RemoteWrite as additional labels
- Server: Support for synchronizing CloneSet and Advanced StatefulSet workloads in OpenKruise (thanks to `@lockerroom`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3368))
- Agent: Added support for so plugin capabilities, providing a C SDK

## Optimizations

- Agent: Changed the periodic reporting interval of long flows from absolute 0 seconds (start of each minute) to relative 0 seconds (relative to the start time of the flow every 60 minutes)
  - Advantage: Reduced the pressure of sending flow logs at absolute 0 seconds, avoiding splitting flows with a lifecycle of less than 60 seconds into two flow logs
- Server: Real-time push to Agent when resource information changes are detected

# v6.3.3 [2023/07/13]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics: Dubbo protocol supports parsing event and serialization_id fields
- AutoTracing: Support for parsing TraceID in MySQL statements (thanks to `@zhangfane`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/2985), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/2999))

## Optimizations

- Prometheus Integration: PromQL API supports RFC3339 time format
- Agent
  - Added kprobe-blacklist configuration item to set port number blacklist for eBPF data collection, avoiding collection loops
  - eBPF adapted to kernel 5.10.0-106.18.0.68.oe2209.x86_64 (thanks to `@innlym`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3542))
- Server: Independent configuration of synchronization intervals for different cloud platforms

# v6.3.2 [2023/06/29]
