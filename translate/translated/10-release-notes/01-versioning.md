# Version Naming

DeepFlow adheres to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) method for version naming. The version number format is `X.Y.Z`, where `X` stands for Major Version, `Y` represents Minor Version, and `Z` is the Patch Version.

# Iteration Cycle

- The major version number X changes approximately every `two years`
- The minor version number Y changes approximately every `four months`
- The patch version number Z changes approximately every `two weeks`

# Version Maintenance Time

- The largest `Z` version in each `X.Y` version is the long-term support (LTS, Long-Term Support) version
- After each `X.Y.Z` version is released, all `X.Y.0` - `X.Y.{Z-1}` versions are no longer maintained or updated
