# v6.2.6.5 [2023/05/17]

## New Features (GA)

- AutoTracing
  - Provide Trace Completion API `tracing-completion-by-external-app-spans`: Callers can input a set of APP Spans (no need to store them in DeepFlow) to obtain their upstream and downstream SYS/NET Spans, enhancing traditional APM with infrastructure and non-instrumented service tracing capabilities. [See the detailed documentation here](../integration/output/query/trace-completion/)
- WASM Plugin
  - Introduce WebAssembly Plugin mechanism to support the parsing of private protocols and enhance the field parsing capabilities of standard protocols. [See the detailed documentation here](../integration/process/wasm-plugin/)
