# v6.6.3 [2024/08/15]

## Beta Feature

- AutoTracing
  - When the TraceID is present in the protocol header, support disabling eBPF syscall_trace_id calculation (via configuration `syscall_trace_id_disabled`) to reduce the impact on business performance.
  - Automatically correct minor clock deviations between different machines in the distributed tracing flame graph.
- AutoTagging
  - Support using Lua Plugin to customize K8s workload abstraction rules, [documentation](../integration/process/lua-plugin/).
- Agent
  - Support completely disabling cBPF data collection (via configuration `tap_interface_regex` as an empty string) to reduce memory overhead.
  - Support deepflow-agent to use a single socket to transmit all observability data, and this feature can be disabled via the `multiple_sockets_to_ingester` configuration item to use multiple sockets to improve transmission performance.

## Stable Feature

- AutoProfiling
  - Support viewing DeepFlow eBPF On-CPU Profiling data in the Grafana Panel, [Demo](https://ce-demo.deepflow.yunshan.net/d/Continuous_Profiling/continuous-profiling?var-app_service=deepflow-server).
- AutoMetrics
  - Support aligning timestamps of request and response metrics in the same session to help AIOps systems better achieve root cause localization (thanks to `pegasusljn`：[FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/7069)).
- AutoTagging
  - Correctly mark the Universal Tag for loopback network card traffic on K8s Node.
- Agent
  - Reduce the number of sockets used by deepflow-agent to send data.
    - Merge the sockets used to transmit open_telemetry and open_telemetry_compressed data when integrating OpenTelemetry.
    - Merge the sockets used to transmit deepflow_stats and agent_log data for agent self-monitoring.
    - Merge the sockets used to transmit prometheus and telegraf metrics when integrating Prometheus and Telegraf.

# v6.6.2 [2024/08/01]

## Beta Feature

- AutoMetrics
  - Support aligning timestamps of request and response metrics in the same session to help AIOps systems better achieve root cause localization (thanks to `pegasusljn`：[FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/7069)).

## Stable Feature

- AutoTracing
  - Optimize the default values of configuration parameters for NTP clock offset (`host_clock_offset_us`) and network transmission delay (`network_delay_us`) used in network Span tracing to reduce the probability of mismatches.

# v6.6.1 [2024/07/18]

## Beta Feature

- AutoTagging
  - Correctly mark the Universal Tag for loopback network card traffic on K8s Node.

## Stable Feature

- AutoTracing
  - Added URL desensitization capability for HTTP protocol, Redis protocol desensitization enabled by default.
- AutoTagging
  - Support synchronizing Volcengine resource tags, [documentation](../features/auto-tagging/meta-tags/).
  - Cancel synchronization of Pods in K8s Evicted state to reduce resource overhead.
- Integration
  - Optimize the mapping of fields such as schema/target in OTel Span to `l7_flow_log`, [documentation](../features/l7-protocols/otel/).
- Agent
  - Support aggregating and collecting traffic from multiple member physical network cards of the Open vSwitch bond interface.

# v6.6.0 [2024/07/04]

## Backward Incompatible Change

- AutoProfiling
  - Use Dataframe return format to compress response size and improve API performance, [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/7011), [documentation](../features/continuous-profiling/data/).
