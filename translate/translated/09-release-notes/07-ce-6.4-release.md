# v6.4.9 [2024/01/18]

## New Features

- API
  - SQL API adds the Derivative pre-operator, which can calculate the difference for Prometheus Counter type metrics to compute the rate.
  - SQL API adds TopK and Any operators to obtain high-frequency or arbitrary values of specified tags.
- CLI
  - Supports debugging eBPF Socket Data using deepflow-ctl.
- Agent
  - The eBPF functionality of the Agent is adapted to the Linux 3.10 kernel ([detailed documentation](../ce-install/overview/#运行权限及内核要求)).

## Optimizations

N/A

# v6.4.7 [2024/01/04]

## New Features

# v6.4.6 [2023/12/28]

## Optimizations

- AutoProfiling
  - When enabling the Profiling feature, there is no need to generate symbol table files in the Pod where the Java process resides.
- Server

- Wasm
  - Wasm Plugin supports dynamic loading in the Agent.

# v6.4.5 [2023/12/21]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis protocol data support obfuscation, which can be enabled through the Agent's `obfuscate-enabled-protocols` (thanks to `eddietanshuo`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/2516)).

- Integration
  - Server supports exporting metrics via the Prometheus RemoteWrite protocol (thanks to `chenjiandongx`: [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4918)).

## Optimizations

- Server

# v6.4.4 [2023/12/07]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics

- AutoProfiling
  - Supports displaying a universal CPU flame graph of all processes on a server, down to the thread level.
  - Interleaves the generation of Java process symbol tables in a staggered manner to avoid high load caused by clustering, supporting the modification of the Agent's `java-symbol-file-refresh-defer-interval` configuration item to adjust the base interval of the delay.
- Server
  - Supports balancing the data sending Server based on the amount of data sent by the Agent, improving the data balance of ClickHouse (thanks to `jiekun`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/4635)).

## Optimizations

- Server
  - Modified the logic of the Avg operator, where Avg represents the use of a weighted average algorithm, and AAvg represents the use of an arithmetic average algorithm.
- Agent
  - Reduced memory consumption by 60% in scenarios with a large number of new TCP flows ([PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4345), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4735), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4803), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4694)).
- Integration
  - Supports an extensible Exporter interface (thanks to `jiekun`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/4230), [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3926)).

# v6.4.3 [2023/11/23]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics
  - Supports parsing all encrypted application protocols over TLS, not limited to HTTP (thanks to `dirtyren`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3797)).
- AutoTagging
  - Supports synchronizing tag information of cloud servers from Tencent Cloud and Huawei Cloud, and supports synchronizing resource set information of cloud servers from Alibaba Cloud.

## Optimizations

- AutoMetrics
  - Streamlined connection metrics in flow logs, removing redundant `rtt_client_avg` and `rtt_server_avg`.
  - Optimized the default parsing port for DNS traffic, adding `5353`, see the Agent's `l7-protocol-ports` configuration item for details.
- AutoTagging
  - Deprecated the Others type in `l7_protocol` (application protocol), merging `HTTP_TLS` and `HTTP2_TLS` into HTTP and HTTP2, adding `is_tls` in call logs to indicate whether it is encrypted traffic.

# v6.4.2 [2023/11/09]

## New Features

- AutoTracing
  - Supports extracting `trace_id` from SofaRPC Payload (Hessian encoding, TreeMap structure).
  - Supports extracting TraceID fields injected by SkyWalking and OpenTelemetry in Kafka messages.
  - Supports parsing SkyWalking sw3 Header (thanks to `Wadud-Ma`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/4449), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4595)).
