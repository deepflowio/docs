# v6.1.1 [2022/08/25]

V6.1.1 took three months to develop, marking a major iteration of the V6 series and the first community edition of DeepFlow. From now on, the enterprise and community editions will iterate simultaneously, moving to a `bi-weekly minor version release` cycle, with the final minor version of V6.1 (LTS version) released after approximately four minor versions.

To create a <mark>highly automated</mark> open-source observability platform, we made significant adjustments to the software architecture in this version, including merging excessive microservices, eliminating some components' dependencies on DaemonSet, HostNet deployment modes, and refactoring some Python modules with Golang.

Most importantly, we greatly enhanced application performance monitoring capabilities in this version:

- Support integrating and associating OpenTelemetry, SkyWalking tracing data, unlocking full-stack distributed tracing capabilities, and improving communication efficiency between different development teams
