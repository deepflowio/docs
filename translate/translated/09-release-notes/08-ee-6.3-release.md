# Universal Map, Applications, Network, Infrastructure, Events

- AutoMetrics
  - Support parsing FastCGI protocol
  - Support parsing Hang Seng T3 protocol
  - Dubbo protocol supports parsing event and serialization_id fields
  - Recognize RST disconnections in SLB health checks as normal behavior
  - Added endpoint field in the application aggregation metrics table
  - Support collecting statement-id of MySQL calls to correlate COM_STMT_EXECUTE and COM_STMT_QUERY, thereby tracing SQL statements
- AutoTracing
  - Support parsing Tingyun's Tracing field `X-Tingyun`
  - Support tracing calls before and after managed ALB/SLB services
  - Support parsing TraceID in MySQL statements
  - Added allow_multiple_trace_ids_in_tracing_result configuration item to allow multiple TraceIDs in tracing results
  - Support calling APM's Trace API to supplement tracing data
- AutoTagging
  - Support automatic association of K8s Annotations and Env tags
  - Added capability to automatically associate K8s containers via PID, solving the issue of marking container resource information for HostNetwork Pods in eBPF data
- SQL
  - Added count operator to metrics to calculate the number of rows of raw data
- Universal Map
  - Optimized service list
    - Only display performance metrics when the service is called
    - Support switching signal sources via signal_source
    - Adjusted the default displayed metrics and show bar charts representing the relative size of metrics
  - Added service topology
    - Support defining integrated business access topology for cloud and on-premises
- Applications
  - Distributed Tracing
    - Adjusting the vertical split ratio of the right-slide page does not scale the flame graph
    - Support tracing starting from network Span
    - Flame graph supports displaying network Span's collection NIC information
    - Left quick filter box supports quick filtering and switching of signal sources
  - Continuous Profiling
    - Support linked display of tables and flame graphs
    - Optimized merging logic of Function Stack in flame graph
    - Compressed storage of Function Stack in ClickHouse
    - Support eBPF collection of OnCPU Profile data for compiled (Golang/Rust, etc.) and interpreted (Java, etc.) languages
- Infrastructure
  - Added host and container pages, displayed based on Prometheus metrics
- Events
  - Split the events page into three pages: resource changes, file read/write, and alert practices
- GUI
  - Enhanced search snapshot capabilities: support sorting, condition copying, etc.
  - Search bar supports pasting `Key: value` search conditions
  - Search bar supports modifying the operator of existing conditions
  - Simplified page search conditions and conditions carried by the right-slide page, improving usability
  - Comprehensive optimization of page UI
  - Optimized left quick filter box: support search filtering, display matching data volume, support filtering metric value ranges, support switching query areas, support switching data tables
  - Support continuously opening multiple right-slide pages and switching between different right-slide pages
  - Event data displayed in the right-slide page can be switched to view client-side or server-side events separately
  - Popup page for viewing database fields supports displaying table names
  - Support viewing search conditions of the current Panel

# Dashboards, Metrics, Alerts, Reports

- Dashboards
  - Support dragging to modify table size
  - Optimized display details of bar charts
  - Added new Panel type: overview map
  - Refactored Panel editing page
  - Optimized layout of Panel buttons
  - Merged line chart and Top line chart
  - Optimized display of template variable names when too long
  - Template variable list supports drag-and-drop sorting
- Metrics
  - Support inputting PromQL to query data
- Alerts
  - Support creating alert policies directly (without creating a Dashboard)
  - HTTP push endpoints support using Tags to render push content
  - Email push titles support using variables
  - Optimized display of system alert events
- GUI
  - Unified search condition input boxes for Panel editing page, metric search page, and alert policy editing page

# Resources, System

- Resources
  - Optimized display of POD list, VPC list, availability zone list, and region list, added container node count and collector status columns
  - Support synchronizing CloneSet and Advanced StatefulSet workloads in `OpenKruise`
  - Support independent configuration of synchronization intervals for different cloud platforms
  - Support synchronizing IP addresses on loopback interfaces (usually VIPs)
- Integration
  - Prometheus Integration
    - PromQL supports topk and bottomk functions
    - PromQL API supports RFC3339 time format
    - Support obtaining HTTP Headers in RemoteWrite as additional Labels
    - Optimized storage performance of RemoteWrite, and query performance of RemoteRead and PromQL
  - OpenTelemetry Integration
    - Support running independently of ClickHouse
- Agent
  - Plugin
    - Added support for so plugins, providing C SDK
    - Wasm Demo: Parse error codes in HTTP Payload and reassign response_code and response_exception
    - Wasm Demo: Parse Protobuf messages in Payload
  - Changed the periodic reporting interval of long streams from absolute 0 seconds (start of each minute) to relative 0 seconds (whole 60 minutes relative to stream start time)
    - Advantage: Reduced pressure of sending stream logs at absolute 0 seconds, avoiding splitting streams with a lifecycle of less than 60 seconds into two stream logs
  - Configuration
    - Support configuring CPU affinity and priority
    - Added kprobe-blacklist configuration item to set port number blacklist for eBPF data collection, avoiding collection loops
    - Added options to ignore statistics positions for stream logs (l4_log_ignore_tap_sides) and call logs (l7_log_ignore_tap_sides) to reduce data collection volume
  - Adaptation
    - Support running in Tencent TCE's DPDK host machine
    - Removed HostNetwork requirement for container collectors
    - Support environments where the number of matching NICs (tap_interface_regex) exceeds 255
    - Support running in business Pods in Sidecar mode
    - Support deployment as a BlueKing Plugin
- Server
  - Support configuring system alert mailbox on the page
  - Default auto-deletion time for anomaly controllers and data nodes set to 30 days
  - Unified storage of alert events in ClickHouse
  - Real-time push to Agent when resource information changes are detected
  - Support disabling K8s cluster auto-discovery, allowing synchronization as an affiliated K8s cluster of public cloud
  - Support specifying (fixing) Agent for K8s resource information synchronization
  - Added deepflow identifier to all HostPath paths required for deployment
- CLI
  - Released deepflow-ctl for MacOS
