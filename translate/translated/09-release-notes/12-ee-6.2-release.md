# Dashboards, Alerts, Reports

- Review and refine the wording of all system alerts
- Packet loss environment threshold alert policies for all collectors and data nodes

# Resources

- AutoTagging
  - **Support synchronizing process information on container nodes and cloud servers**, and inject it as Universal Tag into all data, supporting filtering and grouping

  - Support automatic synchronization of K8s cluster information under AWS and Alibaba Cloud accounts
  - Support synchronizing Baidu Cloud Cloud Smart Network (CSN) resource information
  - Add support for K8s Service in the Custom Tag field k8s.label

- Usability
  - Support batch input of load balancer and its listener information
  - Support batch input of Gateway type host and its NIC
  - Support unified setting of `additional docking route interfaces` for all managed K8s clusters under a public cloud account

  - Adapt resource information synchronization for K8s 1.18, 1.20
  - Add two configuration items for Huawei public cloud: domain name and IAM authorization address, to adapt to HCSO scenarios

# System

- API
  - **Querier adds support for PromQL**
    - Support querying DeepFlow native metrics via PromQL
    - Support querying Prometheus RemoteWrite metrics via PromQL
    - When querying Prometheus native metrics, support using tags automatically injected by DeepFlow AutoTagging
  - **Ingester adds support for OTLP Export**
    - Support exporting SYS/NET Span data (l7_flow_log) to otel-collector, [see the documentation for output fields here](../integration/output/export/opentelemetry-exporter/), [FR-014-Tencent](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/2304).
  - Querier SQL API
    - Provide **Trace Completion API `tracing-completion-by-external-app-spans`**: the caller passes in a set of APP Spans (no need to store them in DeepFlow) to get their upstream and downstream SYS/NET Spans, enhancing traditional APM with infrastructure and non-instrumented service tracing capabilities, [see the specific documentation here](../integration/output/query/trace-completion/)
    - Add support for the AS keyword and return the original field name before AS in the results
    - When getting optional values for enum type Tag fields, return the description information corresponding to the values

    - Unify the Category of custom type Tags (k8s.label/cloud.tag/os.app) as map_item
    - Add three Universal Tags: tap_port_host, tap_port_chost, tap_port_pod_node, representing the host, cloud server, and container node to which the collection NIC belongs, respectively
- Grafana
  - **Prometheus Dashboard can use DeepFlow as a data source without modification**
  - In the Query Editor, support referencing the `$__interval` variable for the Math operator
  - Optimize Enum type Variable to avoid expanding all candidate values in SQL when selecting All

- Compatibility
  - Support running the collector in Linux Kernel environments below 3.0
  - Support specifying the Hostname of the environment where the collector is located, suitable for environments with hostname conflicts
