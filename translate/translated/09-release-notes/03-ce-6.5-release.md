# v6.5.9 [2024/06/20]

## Stable Feature

- eBPF AutoTracing
  - Added parsing capability for ZeroMQ ZMTP protocol, [documentation here](../features/l7-protocols/mq/#zmtp).
  - Supports collecting MySQL login usernames and current database names, [documentation here](../features/l7-protocols/sql/#mysql).
  - Supports gRPC Streaming communication mode call log collection and distributed tracing (thanks to `ZhuoZhuoCrayon`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/6042)).
- AutoTagging
  - Significantly improved real-time K8s label injection. The optimized code path involves 1 10s timer and 1 1min timer, reducing the **worst-case delay from 5min to 1m20s** (the agent's list/watch of K8s resources may span two cycles, potentially causing a 20s delay).
  - Decoupled synchronization of cloud resources and container resources, ensuring that public cloud API errors do not affect the synchronization of container resource labels.
- Integration
  - Supports integration with [Datadog Vector](https://vector.dev/) for application log collection.
- Server
  - Added global configuration for whether the Agent requests the Server NAT IP, suitable for scenarios where all Agents request the Server via the public network.
- Agent
  - Supports collecting traffic from Open vSwitch Bond sub-interfaces and correctly aggregating them into flow logs and call logs.
  - Improved eBPF collection performance [test data to be supplemented].

# v6.5.8 [2024/06/06]

## Beta Feature

- eBPF AutoTracing
  - Supports gRPC Streaming communication mode call log collection and distributed tracing (thanks to `ZhuoZhuoCrayon`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/6042)).
- AutoTagging
  - Significantly improved real-time K8s label injection. The optimized code path involves 1 10s timer and 1 1min timer, reducing the **worst-case delay from 5min to 1m20s** (the agent's list/watch of K8s resources may span two cycles, potentially causing a 20s delay).
  - Decoupled synchronization of cloud resources and container resources, ensuring that public cloud API errors do not affect the synchronization of container resource labels.

## Stable Feature

- Agent
  - Supports configuring a call log blacklist to reduce storage consumption and metric interference (thanks to `chrisdamon` and `novohool`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/5916)).
- Server
  - Prometheus Remote Write supports exporting `flow_metrics.application*` and `flow_metrics.network*` metrics.
  - Added Kafka Exporter data export method, [documentation here](../integration/output/export/kafka-exporter/), supporting the export of the following observability signals:
    - Metrics: `flow_metrics.application*` (application performance metrics/access relationships), `flow_metrics.network*` (network performance metrics/access relationships).
    - Logs: `flow_log.l4_flow_log` (network flow logs), `flow_log.l7_flow_log` (application call logs).
