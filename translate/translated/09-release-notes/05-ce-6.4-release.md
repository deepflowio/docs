# v6.4.9 [2024/01/18]

## New Features

- API
  - SQL API adds the Derivative pre-operator to calculate the difference for Prometheus Counter type metrics, thereby calculating the rate.
  - SQL API adds TopK and Any operators to obtain the high-frequency or any value of a specified Tag.
- CLI
  - Support debugging eBPF Socket Data using deepflow-ctl.
- Agent
  - The eBPF functionality of the Agent is adapted to the Linux 3.10 kernel ([detailed documentation](../ce-install/overview/#运行权限及内核要求)).

## Optimizations

# v6.4.6 [2023/12/28]

## Optimizations

- AutoProfiling
  - When enabling Profiling, there is no need to generate symbol table files in the Pod where the Java process is located.
- Server

- AutoProfiling
  - Support displaying a universal CPU flame graph of all processes on a server, down to the thread granularity.

- Server
  - Support balancing the data sending Server based on the amount of data sent by the Agent, improving the data volume balance of ClickHouse (thanks to `jiekun`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/4635)).

## Optimizations

- Server
  - Modified the logic of the Avg operator, where Avg represents the use of a weighted average algorithm, and AAvg represents the use of an arithmetic average algorithm.
- Agent
  - Reduced memory consumption by 60% in scenarios with a large number of new TCP flows ([PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4345), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4735), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4803), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/4694)).
- Integration
  - Support for an extensible Exporter interface (thanks to `jiekun`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/4230), [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3926)).

# v6.4.3 [2023/11/23]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics
  - Support parsing all encrypted application protocols over TLS, not limited to HTTP (thanks to `dirtyren`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3797)).
- AutoTagging
  - Support synchronization of tag information for cloud servers in Tencent public cloud and Huawei public cloud, and support synchronization of resource set information for cloud servers in Alibaba public cloud.

## Optimizations

- AutoMetrics
  - Simplified connection metrics in flow logs, removing redundant `rtt_client_avg` and `rtt_server_avg`.
  - Optimized the default parsing port for DNS traffic, adding `5353`, see the Agent's `l7-protocol-ports` configuration item.
- AutoTagging
  - Deprecated the Others type in `l7_protocol` (application protocol), merging `HTTP_TLS` and `HTTP2_TLS` into HTTP and HTTP2, adding `is_tls` in call logs to indicate whether it is encrypted traffic.

# v6.4.2 [2023/11/09]

## New Features

- AutoTracing
