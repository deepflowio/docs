The DeepFlow Agent needs to inject IP tags into the data so that the DeepFlow Server can use them to derive all other tags. For log data using the [Kubernetes_Log](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/kubernetes_logs/) module of Vector, it automatically discovers and appends the PodName of the log source to the log stream, enabling DeepFlow to automatically match the data source.

With DeepFlowâ€™s AutoTagging capability, we automate the association between tracing data and other observability data, without requiring developers to insert any code.
