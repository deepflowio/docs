The universal map allows users to define each business independently, as well as each service or service group within the business, enabling users to build their own service topology in a more scenario-oriented way.

The universal map in DeepFlow is divided into three main pages, which will be described in detail below.

- [Business Definition](./business-def/)
- [Service List](./service-list/)
- [Service Topology](./service-map/)
