# Business Definition

A business definition includes the business name, the definition of the data table, as well as the definitions of service groups, services, and paths within the business. The following section explains in detail how to define them.

![00-Terms Explanation](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/202310196530f64f1d682.jpg)

A business can consist of multiple `services` and `paths`. `Services` can be fully user-defined and added to a `custom service group`; alternatively, you can define only the service group, and the `services` will be automatically generated within the group — this is referred to as an `auto-grouped service group`. `Paths` are defined by specifying the access relationships between services. The diagram above illustrates the following:

- Business: Mobile Banking Business
- Services:
  - Independent service not in any group: Frontend Load Service
  - Added to a custom service group, frontend service group: Operations Frontend Service, Financial Frontend Service
  - Services generated by an auto-grouped service group, middle platform service group: Benefits Center Service, Search Center Service, Average Center Service, Payment Center Service
- Paths:
  - Custom: Frontend Load Service -> Operations Frontend Service; Frontend Load Service -> Financial Frontend Service; Operations Frontend Service -> Middle Platform Service Group (auto-grouped); Financial Frontend Service -> Middle Platform Service Group (auto-grouped)
  - Auto-generated: Access relationships between services within the Middle Platform Service Group (auto-grouped)

## Business List

### Create Business

![02-Create Business](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e3d393f6.png)

- Name: Required, the business name
- Data Table: Required, the data table from which the business data is sourced
  - To view network metrics for the business, select `Network - Path - Metrics Data (xx)`; to view application metrics, select `Application - Path - Metrics Data (xx)`
- Metrics: Depending on the data table, you can use the corresponding metrics
  - Up to 10 metrics can be set

### Business Details Page

The business details page consists of two main parts: `Basic Information & Actions` and `Details List`. Here you can define the `services`, `service groups`, and `paths` for the current business.

#### Services

![03-Services](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e3e6a56d.png)

- Basic Information & Actions
  - Basic Information: Displays the data table, metrics, and the count of services, service groups, and paths for the business
    - Click the count to quickly switch the list below to the corresponding `services`, `service groups`, or `paths`
  - Actions:
    - Edit: Modify the business name, data table, and metrics. For details, see the **Create Business** section
    - Star: After starring, the business will be prioritized in the `Business List` page
    - Service Topology: Go to the `Service Topology` page to view the topology of the business. For details, see **[Service Topology](./service-map/)** section
    - Service List: Go to the `Service List` page to view the topology of the business. For details, see **[Service List](./service-list/)** section
- Service List: Displays information about all services in the current business, with options to edit or delete
  - For example, Redis/DNS/Access Client/Stress Test Client are all independent services

![04-Create Service](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e3fcabc4.png)

- Name: Required, service names must be unique within the same business
- Icon: The service icon displayed in `Service Topology` and `Service List`. Currently selectable from `Resource - Icon`
- Filter Conditions: Define service data based on filter conditions, supporting `bi-directional` or `uni-directional` queries
  - Set client and server separately: If checked, use separate filter condition boxes for client and server for `uni-directional` filtering; if unchecked, use `bi-directional` filtering
  - Direction: Define filter conditions for the service in different roles
    - Bi-directional: A single filter condition box applies to both client and server roles
    - Uni-directional: Two filter condition boxes for `Server` and `Client`
      - Server: Filter conditions when acting as a server
      - Client: Filter conditions when acting as a client
  - For filter condition operations, see the **[Query](../query/overview/)** section
    - Group: Defaults to `*`
- Service Group: Supports adding to a `custom type service group`. A `service` can only belong to one `service group`. For the definition of `service groups`, see the following section
- Metric Thresholds: Adjust metric thresholds for each service
  - Metrics are collapsed by default; click the expand button to view and edit
  - When a metric exceeds the threshold, the corresponding `service` will be highlighted in red

#### Service Groups

![05-Service Groups](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e41e9e32.png)

- Service Group List: Each row represents a group of services in the business. For example, a frontend service group can include APP access services and Web access services. DeepFlow service groups can be user-defined by adding custom services one by one, or they can be formed from a set of automatically identified services.

![06-Create Service Group](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e4586d8e.png)

- Name: Required, service group names must be unique within the same business
- Type: Two types — `Auto-grouped` and `Custom`
  - Custom: User-defined, allows manually selecting `services` to join
  - Auto-grouped: A service group formed from services automatically identified based on `filter conditions`
    - Group: Can be grouped by auto_service or [custom auto-grouping tags](../../../features/auto-tagging/custom-tags)
    - For `Direction` and `Filter Conditions` instructions, see the **Services** section
- Metric Thresholds

#### Paths

![07-Paths](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e4869fe5.png)

- Path List: Each row represents a path from a `service`/`service group` to another `service`/`service group`. For example, `Client = Service A, Server = Service B` means that `Service A` accesses `Service B` based on the `client` filter conditions for Service A and the `server` filter conditions for Service B.
  - Bulk Delete: Select checkboxes to delete multiple items at once

![08-Create Path](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/2024040766124e4a3bd2a.png)

- Name: Required, path name
- Client: Multi-select, options include `All`, `custom service groups`, and `auto-grouped` service groups
- Server: Multi-select, options include `All`, `custom service groups`, and `auto-grouped` service groups
- All: Selects all custom service groups and auto-grouped service groups
