- Step 2: Configure the report policy according to your push requirements.
  - Fill in the policy name, cycle, report format, statistical granularity, push email address, and other information.
  - Note: Reports generated by the policy will be pushed to the email daily.
    - For example, if the cycle is set to a weekly report, the report for the previous week (e.g., last Tuesday to this Tuesday) will be pushed daily. The report covers from 00:00 on the start date to 24:00 on the end date. Any modification to the report policy will take effect from the day it is made and will only affect subsequent reports, without impacting previously generated reports. The report email will include the report as an attachment, which can be downloaded by clicking.
