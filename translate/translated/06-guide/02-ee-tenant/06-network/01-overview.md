# Overview

The DeepFlow network module offers a wide range of features to help users monitor path traffic and network performance in real time, including resource node information, flow log data, NAT tracing, PCAP download, traffic distribution, and resource inventory. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and evaluation of performance metrics such as transmitted traffic, latency, and packet loss rate, allowing timely detection and resolution of network congestion, failures, and security issues. This improves network stability and reliability, ensuring efficient network operation.
