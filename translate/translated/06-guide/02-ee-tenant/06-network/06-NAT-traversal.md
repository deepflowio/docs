# NAT Tracing

NAT tracing can initiate tracing for any TCP four-tuple or five-tuple, and uses DeepFlowâ€™s proprietary algorithm to automatically trace traffic before and after NAT. The NAT tracing page displays the metrics corresponding to the four-tuple of the clicked data in a table format. Clicking `Trace` will initiate tracing for the four-tuple.
