# Resource Inventory

Resource inventory involves taking stock of and managing various resources required by applications in the system, including computing resources, network resources, storage resources, and more. Typically, these resources are provided to applications in a virtualized manner. Through resource inventory, system administrators can gain a better understanding of resource allocation and utilization, enabling more efficient resource scheduling and optimization, improving system performance and security, and also reducing costs.
