# Alert Events

The Alert Events page displays events generated by alert policy monitoring. For example, when the system detects security vulnerabilities, abnormal behavior, or other situations that require user attention, it will generate corresponding alert events and provide detailed descriptions and recommendations.

Users can filter and search based on multiple dimensions such as policy level, event level, monitored object, creator, monitored object, region, and event UID.
