# Push Endpoint

Push endpoints are systems or services used to receive and process alerts. Currently, four push methods are supported: Email push, HTTP push, Kafka push, PCAP policy, and Syslog push.

The following sections introduce these five push methods in detail.

## Email Push

Sends alert events to a specified email address, allowing you to stay informed of alerts by checking your email.
