# Change Events

On the Change Events page, users can view events occurring in the system in real time, such as usage, file creation, file deletion, and more. Users can filter event types as needed and quickly locate events of interest.

Users can view events that occurred within a specific time range, or filter by user or resource to better understand the details and context of the events.
