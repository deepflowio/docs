# Network Services

Network services display relevant data information for different components in a cloud computing network architecture, including security groups, NAT gateways, load balancers, peering connections, and cloud enterprise networks.

## Security Group

A security group is a type of virtual network security mechanism in cloud computing that can control inbound and outbound traffic of cloud instances, thereby protecting the security of cloud instances and the cloud network.

- All security group rules: Supports viewing all security group rules, including direction, IP type, protocol type, local port range, remote port range, and other information, and also supports exporting to CSV.
- Operations
  - View security group rules: Supports viewing all rules of the selected security group.
- For the usage of other buttons on the page, please refer to the **[Resource Pool - Region](./network-resources/)** section.

## NAT Gateway

A NAT gateway can perform network address translation between different subnets and enable communication between private network instances and the Internet. On the NAT gateway page, you can view and download related information such as public IP, region, VPC, number of gateway rules, cloud platform, etc., and also view and download gateway rule information.

## Load Balancer

In cloud computing, a load balancer distributes traffic from virtual machines to multiple virtual machines by adjusting the traffic, thereby achieving load balancing and improving the availability and scalability of applications. On the load balancer page, you can view and download related information such as IP, region, VPC, number of load balancers, cloud platform, etc., and also view and download rule information.

## Peering Connection

A peering connection is a local network connection service that supports establishing virtual private network interconnections between geographically different VPCs. On the peering connection page, you can view related information such as local region, local VPC, peer region, peer VPC, cloud platform, etc., and also create new peering connections and export to CSV.

- For the usage of page buttons, please refer to the **[Resource Pool - Region](./network-resources/)** section.

## Cloud Enterprise Network

A cloud enterprise network is a cloud computing solution that provides interconnection between private networks and public networks, and can also achieve network interconnection between multiple different cloud providers, improving the security, stability, and reliability of data communication. On the cloud enterprise network page, you can view related information such as associated instances, cloud platform, etc., and also export to CSV.
