# Add Chart

A dashboard is composed of one or a group of `charts`. This chapter will explain how to add a `chart` to a `dashboard`.

Currently, charts can only be added to a `dashboard` from the feature pages, including charts from the `Metrics`, `Application`, and `Network` feature pages.

**Step 1**: Go to the feature module page where you want to add the chart. For example, click `① Application - Service` to enter the `Service Overview` page.
