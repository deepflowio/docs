# Pie Chart

A pie chart represents data for each category by dividing a whole circle into multiple sectors, providing an intuitive view of the relative size and proportion of the data. In DeepFlow, you can visualize data in the form of a `pie chart` by using the `switch display mode` option in a `table`.
