# Bar Chart

A bar chart represents data for different categories by drawing a series of vertical or horizontal bars, providing an intuitive view of the size and distribution of the data. In DeepFlow, you can visualize data in the form of a `bar chart` by using the `switch display mode` option in a `table`.
