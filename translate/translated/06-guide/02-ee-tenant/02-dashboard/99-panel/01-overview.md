# Overview

A chart is the smallest unit visualization component in DeepFlow. It serves as the visualization component for each functional page and can also be added to a Dashboard to create a customized visualization view. Each chart can be operated independently, and users can modify the search criteria, metrics, styles, and other settings of the chart according to their needs.

DeepFlow supports various types of charts. Next, we will introduce how to use the following charts:
