DeepFlow is a highly automated observability platform that provides application and network metrics, events, tracing, and log data. With its AutoTagging capability, it injects unified attribute tags into all observability data. When dealing with massive volumes of data, DeepFlow not only offers productized analytical capabilities but also supports fast search. As an efficient information retrieval tool, the search box enables quick and accurate lookup and filtering in the face of large-scale data. This chapter focuses on how to use the DeepFlow search box.

The DeepFlow search box can be categorized into four main types, and this chapter will provide a detailed explanation of each type and its common application scenarios.

- [Resource Search Box](./service-search/)
- [Path Search Box](./path-search/)
- [Log Search Box](./log-search/)
- [Metric Search Box](./metric-search/)

In addition to defining the search box, DeepFlow also enhances it with quick search capabilities and search-related configurations.
