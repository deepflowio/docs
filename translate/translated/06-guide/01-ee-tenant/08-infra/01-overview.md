# Overview

DeepFlow integrates with Prometheus data to display infrastructure status, CPU, memory, and other metrics in a list format. Currently, it supports displaying data for `hosts` and `containers`.

- [Hosts](./host/)
- [Containers](./container/)

Note: To use this feature, Prometheus node_exporter data needs to be pushed to DeepFlow. For the pushing method, refer to [Integrating Prometheus Data](../../../integration/input/metrics/prometheus/)
