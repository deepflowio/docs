# Add Panel

A Dashboard is composed of one or more `panels`. This chapter will introduce how to add `panels` to a `dashboard`.

Currently, it only supports adding `panels` to the `dashboard` from the feature pages, including charts from the `Metrics`, `Applications`, and `Network` feature pages.

**Step 1**: Navigate to the feature module page where you want to add a panel, for example, click `① Applications - Services` to enter the `Service Overview` page.
