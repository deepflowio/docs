# Overview

Charts are the smallest unit of visualization components in DeepFlow. They serve as visualization components for each functional page and can also be added to a Dashboard to create custom visual views. Each chart can be operated independently, and users can modify the search conditions, metrics, styles, etc., according to their needs.
