# Resource Changes

On the Resource Changes page, users can see the events happening in the system in real time, such as usage, file creation, file deletion, and so forth. Users can filter event types based on their needs and quickly locate events of interest.

Users can view events occurring within a specific time range based on a time duration, or they can filter events by user or resource to better understand the details and background of the events.
