# Alert

The Alert page can log alarm events in the system. For example, when the system detects security vulnerabilities, abnormal behaviors, or other situations that require user attention, it will generate corresponding alarm events, providing detailed descriptions and suggestions.

Users can filter and query based on various dimensions such as policy level, event level, monitoring object, creator, monitoring object, area, event UID, etc.

- You can use the `column option` function in the table to add the event information you want to view. For details on how to use it, please refer to the chapter 【[Application - Call Log](../application/call-log/)】.
