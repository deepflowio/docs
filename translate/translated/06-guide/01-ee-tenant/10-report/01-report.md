# Report

Reports can be created in the Dashboard and scheduled to be pushed to users in an offline downloadable HTML format, recording the results of the Dashboard during the report period.

## Report Policy

The Report Policy page displays all report policies in a list format.

- Second, set the report policy according to the push requirements.
  - Fill in the information for the report policy name, period, report format, statistical granularity, push email, etc.
  - Note: The reports generated by the policy will be pushed to the email daily.
    - For example, if the period is set to a weekly report, the report for the previous week (e.g., last Tuesday to this Tuesday) will be pushed daily. The report covers from 00:00 on the start date to 24:00 on the end date. Any modifications to the report policy will take effect from the last modification before the report is generated and will affect subsequent reports from that day onwards. Previous reports will not be affected. The report email will include the report attachment, which can be downloaded by clicking.
