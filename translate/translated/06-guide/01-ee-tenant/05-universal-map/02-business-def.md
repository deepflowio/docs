# Business Definition

Business definition includes the business name, the definition of data tables, as well as the definition of service groups, services, and paths within the business. Below is a detailed introduction on how to define them.

![00-Term Explanation](https://yunshan-guangzhou.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pub/pic/202310196530f64f1d682.jpg)

A business can consist of several `services` and `paths`. `Services` can be fully customized by the user and added to `custom service groups`; or service groups can be set up to automatically generate `services` within the group, corresponding to `auto-grouped service groups`. `Paths` are defined by specifying the access relationships of services. The following explains the above diagram:

- Business: Mobile Banking Business
- Services:
  - Independent services not added to any group: Frontend Load Service
  - Added to custom service group, Frontend Service Group: Operations Frontend Service, Financial Frontend Service
  - Services generated by auto-grouped service group, Midend Service Group: Rights Center Service, Search Center Service, Average Center Service, Payment Center Service
- Paths:
  - Custom: Frontend Load Service -> Operations Frontend Service; Frontend Load Service -> Financial Frontend Service; Operations Frontend Service -> Midend Service Group (auto-grouped); Financial Frontend Service -> Midend Service Group (auto-grouped)
  - Auto-generated: Access relationships between services within the Midend Service Group (auto-grouped)
