### Creating a Report Strategy

Next, we'll provide a detailed introduction on how to create a report strategy through the view.

- First step, enter the view where you want to generate the report, click `Settings` and select `Create a new report strategy` to create a report.

- Second step, set the report strategy according to the push requirements.
  - Fill in information such as the name, cycle, report format, statistical granularity, push email, etc. for the report strategy.
  - Note: The report generated by the strategy will be pushed to the email every day. - For example, if the cycle is set to a weekly report, it will push the report for the past week (e.g., from last Tuesday to this Tuesday) every day. The report covers from 0 o'clock on the start date to 24 o'clock on the end date. Each modification of the report strategy will take the last before the report generation as final, and it will start affecting subsequent reports generated from that day, without affecting previous reports. And the report email includes the report attachment, which can be downloaded by clicking on it.
