# Change Events

On the Change Events page, users can view real-time events occurring in the system, such as file creation, file deletion, etc. Users can filter event types as needed and quickly locate events of interest.

Users can view events that occurred within a specific time range or filter by user or resource to better understand the details and context of the events.
