# Push Endpoints

Push endpoints are used to receive and process alerts in systems or services. Currently, four push methods are supported: Email push, HTTP push, Kafka push, PCAP strategy, and Syslog push.

Next, we will introduce these five push methods separately.

## Email Push

Send alert events to a specified email address, allowing you to stay informed about alerts by checking your email.

## PCAP Strategy

Supports adding alert policies to the PCAP strategy for alert monitoring through PCAP.
