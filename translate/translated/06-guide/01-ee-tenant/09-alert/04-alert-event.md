# Alert Events

The Alert Events page displays events generated by alert policies monitoring. For example, when the system detects security vulnerabilities, abnormal behavior, or other situations requiring user attention, corresponding alert events are generated, providing detailed descriptions and recommendations.

Users can filter and query based on multiple dimensions such as policy level, event level, monitored object, creator, monitored object, region, event UID, etc.
