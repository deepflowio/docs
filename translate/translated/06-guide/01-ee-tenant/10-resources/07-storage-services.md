# Storage Services

Storage services are a fundamental service provided by cloud computing platforms that assist users in storing and managing their data objects, whilst offering high availability, reliability, and elastic scalability. In the storage services, you can view the information of the RDS cloud database and the Redis cloud database separately.

## Cloud Database RDS

The cloud database, RDS, serves as a highly available, high-performance, and secure hosted database service. It offers users a convenient and flexible storage service and backup recovery function. It can fulfill the organizational requirements for data storage and management, and assume the corresponding management tasks, thereby improving the working efficiency of the organization. You can view and download related information on the RDS cloud database page, such as region, available zone, VPC, subnet, intranet IP, extranet IP, status, database platform, cloud platform, etc.

## Cloud Database Redis

The cloud database, Redis, is a high-speed cache database service, which simultaneously supports various data structures. It can significantly enhance the speed and performance of data read and write, improve the system's performance and response speed, and can be used to implement the data cache requirements and other functions in various scenarios.
