# Alert

The Alert page can log alarm events in the system. For example, when the system detects security vulnerabilities, abnormal behaviors, or other situations that require user attention, it will generate corresponding alarm events, providing detailed descriptions and suggestions.

Users can filter and query based on various dimensions such as policy level, event level, monitoring object, creator, monitoring object, area, event UID, etc.
